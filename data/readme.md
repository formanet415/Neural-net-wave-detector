ESW TSWF and RSWF data is from 2020-12-27 (venus flyby)

Dust data is from RSWF data from 2021-01-10

All data was created by the dataset_generator_V02.py by resampling the original indexes into common length of 4096 points. The snapshots were split and there is a label vector of same length for every data file describing whether each part of each snapshot contains nothing (0), ESW (1) or DUST(2).
